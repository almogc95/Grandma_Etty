      <H1>About us</H1>
    </strong>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Greetings!</h2>
    <p>We are Almog's 2nd year Jerusalem startups. We always thought and delved into a way to do just a good deed in the
      middle of the day.</p>

    <h3>Our Inspiration</h3>
    <p>In our meeting with the other members of the Good Thought team, we received guidance, and we came up with the
      perfect idea. As a result of the war, many people's lives were destroyed, families fell apart, mothers cried for
      their sons, adults were left alone unable to do anything. We brought these issues up on the table and the story we
      connected with the most is the story of Grandma Etti.</p>

    <h3>Grandma Etti's Story</h3>
    <p>Grandma Etti's grandson visits her at least twice a week, and in his visits he revives her and makes her feel
      important. We thought that every grandparent would like to feel this way, and to our great concern this does not
      happen. That's why we created a site called Grandma Eti.</p>

    <h3>How Our Site Helps</h3>
    <p>The site helps seniors get favors, but not just any favors, these are favors in return. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Benjamin wants to learn chess</strong>, and Grandfather Yossi wants them to help him tidy up the
        house.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Benjamin and Grandfather Yossi meet on the platform, and offer the demand to each other, so that both parties
      leave happy and satisfied.</p>

    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>We believe that with the help of the site we built, seniors will become more active and happier and will still
      feel like a big part of our world.</p>
